To access your CGI you must first create a VM(virtual machine). This is where Azure came into to play. This program to some is used to store data or important information. Azure can also be used for Analytics, Virtual Computing, and Networking. Azure was my key to open up the doors to my other configurations

IIS is good for hosting, running, and managing websites on Windows systems. Some sites are in STATIC form, pages made up of "fixed codes." Others come in the DYNAMIC form which is web programing and database design. Afther deciding your structure you take it to a server. This is when your website is accessable to the world

Remote Desktop (RDS) a feature used as a virturaly identical exsprience while siting at home, work or cafte. How does it work? Through a web portal or computer running a romote destop client app. A user can then connect to a hosts RDS server. Once logged in with authorization the user can then access files, apps, and systems. For my project I used the VM that I created in Azure. With th IP address from the VM I was able to access the server through RDS.
